      "An **AI agent** is a software program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals autonomously. Think of it as an intelligent assistant that doesn't just respond to commands but can proactively plan and execute tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Characteristics:\n",
      "1. **Autonomy** – Operates without constant human intervention.\n",
      "2. **Perception** – Uses sensors, data inputs, or APIs to gather information.\n",
      "3. **Decision-making** – Employs reasoning, rules, or machine learning models to choose actions.\n",
      "4. **Action** – Interacts with environments (digital or physical) via APIs, tools, or robotic actuators.\n",
      "5. **Goal-oriented** – Works toward defined objectives, sometimes learning and adapting over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Examples:\n",
      "- **Virtual Assistants** (e.g., Siri, Alexa) – Basic agents that follow commands.\n",
      "- **Customer Service Chatbots** – Handle queries and escalate issues.\n",
      "- **Autonomous Vehicles** – Perceive roads, navigate, and avoid obstacles.\n",
      "- **Trading Bots** – Analyze markets and execute trades.\n",
      "- **Research Agents** – Browse the web, summarize articles, and compile reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Levels of Sophistication:\n",
      "- **Simple Reflex Agents** – React to current inputs (e.g., thermostat).\n",
      "- **Goal-based Agents** – Plan sequences of actions (e.g., chess AI).\n",
