Modern AI chips can perform calculations incredibly fast, but spend most of their time waiting for data to move between memory and processing units. This data transfer bottleneck has become the primary constraint limiting AI system performance rather than raw computational power.\\n\\nThe new 3D architecture addresses this by vertically stacking processing and memory layers with direct connections, dramatically reducing the physical distance data must travel. Instead of data flowing horizontally across a chip and through external memory interfaces, it moves vertically through much shorter pathways with significantly lower latency.\\n\\n**Sources:**[frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2025.1611658/full)(December 22, 2025)\\n\\nAI Infrastructure Stocks Face Investor Reality Check Despite Strong Fundamentals\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDecember 22, 2025 - AI infrastructure companies experienced sharp stock declines this week as investors questioned massive capital expenditure commitments, even as underlying business fundamentals remained robust.\\n\\nOracle shares have declined 40% from September peaks despite announcing major data center deals. CoreWeave faces scrutiny over construction delays and debt levels. Broadcom dropped significantly despite strong quarterly results. The pattern reveals investor impatience with the “build now, monetize later” approach dominating AI infrastructure spending.\\n\\nThis volatility reflects a deeper market tension. AI infrastructure requires enormous upfront capital with uncertain payback periods. Companies like Oracle have committed to data center leases totaling hundreds of billions of dollars beginning in 2026-2028\\n\\n**Sources:**[Bloomberg](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/market-outlook/2025/12/19/market-outlook-valuation-pressure-keeps-ai-stocks-in-check/) (December 22, 2025)\\n\\nKling AI 2.6 Demonstrates Continued Chinese Video Generation Leadership\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDecember 21, 2025 - Chinese AI company Kuaishou released Kling AI 2.6 with precise voice synchronization and motion control capabilities, showcasing rapid advancement in AI video generation and highlighting the increasingly competitive international landscape.\\n\\n[![Image 4: Kling AI launches Video 2.6 with native audio generation to speed end-to-end content creation](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XcrX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef0ff128-4afb-40a3-8fc2-398cbe8ebcb9_1920x1280.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XcrX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef0ff128-4afb-40a3-8fc2-398cbe8ebcb9_1920x1280.jpeg)\\n\\nThe new version enables creators to specify exact voice characteristics and control character movements with granular precision. Users can now direct lip sync accuracy, facial expressions, body language, and camera movements with specifications that would typically require professional video editing expertise.\\n\\nThis release is significant for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that Chinese AI companies are not merely catching up to Western competitors but are actively pushing the frontier in specific domains. Second, the pace of improvement in video generation has been remarkably faster than other AI modalities.\\n\\n**Sources:**[Kuaishou](https://ir.kuaishou.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kling-ai-launches-video-26-model-simultaneous-audio-visual/)(December 21, 2025)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAdditional Developments This Week\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n**Google Acquires Intersect Power for $4.75B** - Alphabet purchases clean energy developer to secure power capacity for AI infrastructure, addressing critical energy constraints in data center buildout (December 22)\\n\\n**Trump Considers Federal AI Regulation Pre-emption** - Incoming administration explores overriding state AI laws by threatening broadband funding, raising constitutional questions about federal authority (December 21)\\n\\n**Google Med-Gemini Invents Fictional Body Part** - Google’s medical AI model cited a non-existent brain region in diagnostic output, a hallucination that went undetected despite medical expert review (December 22)\\n\\n**No AGI in 2025 Despite Hype** - Major AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind failed to deliver on artificial general intelligence promises that dominated 2025 rhetoric (December 22)\\n\\n**KI-Kennzeichnung Crashes Ad Performance** - Study shows AI-generated advertising with disclosure labels sees click-through rates drop by one-third compared to unlabeled AI content or human-created ads (December 21)\\n\\n**OpenAI Improves Compute Margins to 70%** - OpenAI has significantly improved the economics of its AI services through better server utilization and efficiency gains (December 22)\\n\\n**Chinese AI Models Dominate Open-Source Downloads** - For first time, Chinese developers recorded higher download numbers than US providers for open-source AI models in 2025 (December 21)\\n\\n**Claude Opus 4.5 Reaches 5-Hour Task Horizon** - Anthropic’s model achieves 50% success rate on tasks requiring nearly five hours of sustained autonomous operation (December 21)\\n\\n**ChatGPT Referrals Double While Still Minimal** - ChatGPT referral traffic to publisher sites nearly doubled year-over-year but remains tiny percentage of overall traffic; Google’s Gemini growing faster at 388% increase (December 22)\\n\\n**iRobot Files Bankruptcy, Chinese Takeover** - Saugroboter pioneer iRobot declares insolvency and plans transfer of control to Chinese supplier Shenzhen PICEA Robotics (December 21)\\n\\n**Nvidia Acquires SchedMD for Open-Source Strategy** - GPU giant purchases data center software provider to expand presence in open-source computing infrastructure (December 22)\\n\\n**LG Forces Copilot on Smart TVs** - LG pushes Microsoft’s AI assistant to television owners via software update with no uninstall option available (December 21)\\n\\n**Duke AI Uncovers Simple Rules in Chaos** - New Duke University framework can reduce thousands of variables in complex systems to compact, understandable equations across physics, engineering, and biology (December 22)\\n\\n**Amazon-OpenAI $10B Investment Talks** - Amazon reportedly negotiating major investment in OpenAI at approximately $750 billion valuation (December 21)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n⚙️ Automation News\\n------------------\\n\\nThis week reveals the maturation paradox: major enterprise vendors launch production-ready AI automation platforms while adoption data shows only 5-18% of companies achieving meaningful ROI.

Takes natural language (”The brake system shall activate within 200ms”) and generates formal SysML models automatically while maintaining traceability for safety-critical systems.\\n\\n**Why this is critical:** Engineering teams building regulated systems (aerospace, automotive, medical) need to move faster without compromising compliance. This automates mechanical translation from requirements to models, letting engineers focus on design decisions rather than diagram management. This is automation targeting high-value technical work, not email triage.\\n\\n**Reality check:** IBM playing catch-up to Siemens, PTC, Dassault Systèmes. Adoption in regulated industries is glacial—aerospace/automotive won’t bet safety-critical systems on v1.1 agent capabilities without years of validation. Early adopters will be infrastructure/industrial companies with lower risk tolerance.\\n\\nRead more: [https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/new-ai-automations-for-model-based-systems-engineering](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/new-ai-automations-for-model-based-systems-engineering)\\n\\nSource: IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (December 18, 2025)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**NVIDIA Releases Nemotron 3 for Agentic AI (December 17, 2025)**\\n\\nNVIDIA released Nemotron 3, open reasoning models optimized for multi-agent systems operating across long contexts. Three sizes: Nano (30B), Super (100B), Ultra (500B). Nano offers 4X higher token throughput, supports up to 1 million token context window.\\n\\n**What it means:** NVIDIA positioning as infrastructure layer for agentic automation. The 1M token context window means agents can process entire codebases, full documentation, or complete conversation histories without chunking. 4X throughput improvement = direct cost reduction for companies running agents at scale.\\n\\n**Why this is critical:** Multi-agent systems require models optimized for long-running contexts (agents need memory), multi-agent coordination (agents talking to each other), and high throughput (parallel task execution). This isn’t a ChatGPT competitor—it’s infrastructure for continuous autonomous systems.\\n\\n**Reality check:** “Open” doesn’t mean freely available—licensing restricts competing model development. The 500B Ultra requires $millions in GPU infrastructure. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google already have closed models with similar capabilities. NVIDIA’s play is capturing the “open model” segment of agent builders.\\n\\nRead more: [https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates](https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates)\\n\\nSource: NVIDIA / Crescendo AI (December 17, 2025)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**SS&C Blue Prism: AI Agent Trends Report (December 16, 2025)**\\n\\nSS&C Blue Prism published “AI agent trends in 2026: How autonomous automation is shaping the future.” Report positions their RPA platform evolution toward agentic systems, citing Gartner and Capgemini research on trust in human-AI collaboration.\\n\\n**What it means:** One of the original RPA vendors (founded 2001, acquired by SS&C 2022 for $1.5B) publicly acknowledging that traditional “robotic process automation” is being superseded by agentic AI. This is an incumbent with thousands of enterprise customers admitting their core product category needs fundamental transformation.\\n\\n**Why this is critical:** RPA dominated enterprise automation 2015-2022 with $10B+ market but hit adoption ceiling: too brittle, too labor-intensive, too limited. Agentic AI solves these problems theoretically but also threatens RPA vendors’ business models. If natural language agents can do what took weeks to script, why pay for legacy platforms?\\n\\n**Reality check:** This is defensive positioning. They’re not announcing product capabilities—they’re publishing trends to stay relevant. UiPath already launched Autopilot, Automation Anywhere has AI Document Automation, Microsoft has Power Automate with Copilot. Blue Prism playing catch-up. Strategy: integrate LLM capabilities into existing RPA workflows rather than rebuild from scratch.\\n\\nRead more: [https://www.blueprism.com/resources/blog/future-ai-agents-trends/](https://www.blueprism.com/resources/blog/future-ai-agents-trends/)\\n\\nSource: SS&C Blue Prism (December 16, 2025)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Microsoft Intune December Updates: Workflow Automation (December 12, 2025)**\\n\\nMicrosoft released Intune updates focusing on workflow automation. Key addition: centralized Admin tasks node consolidating previously scattered management functions. Advanced capabilities expanding to M365 E3/E5 licenses in 2026. Security Copilot to all M365 E5 customers. Microsoft Edge for Business entered public preview.\\n\\n**What it means:** Microsoft systematically embedding automation across enterprise IT management stack. Admin tasks centralization addresses classic IT pain point: managing thousands of endpoints across multiple consoles. Edge for Business enables browser-based management without full MDM enrollment—lighter automation for hybrid work scenarios.\\n\\n**Why this is critical:** Intune updates signal Microsoft’s “automation everywhere” strategy. Combining device management + Security Copilot + workflow automation creates integrated platform. Microsoft leveraging platform lock-in: if you’re on M365 E5, incremental cost of advanced Intune capabilities undercuts standalone RPA/IT automation tools.\\n\\n**Reality check:** These are incremental improvements, not revolutionary capabilities. Admin task centralization should have existed years ago. Security Copilot is table stakes—competitors all have AI SOC assistants. Microsoft’s advantage isn’t innovation—it’s integration depth and contractual relationships.\\n\\nRead more: [https://4sysops.com/archives/microsoft-intune-december-updates-workflow-automation-macos-ios-android-enhancements/](https://4sysops.com/archives/microsoft-intune-december-updates-workflow-automation-macos-ios-android-enhancements/)\\n\\nSource: Microsoft / 4sysops (December 12, 2025)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n🛠️ Tools & Resources\\n---------------------\\n\\n**IBM Engineering AI Hub 1.1 (GA)** MBSE agent that interprets natural-language requirements and auto-generates SysML model elements.

At that point, agents hadn’t proven they could consistently do even basic tasks. But fast forward just two years, and agentic technology has made big strides — albeit it’s still relatively unproven as completely autonomous software. Regardless, agents were the biggest development story of 2025 and “agentic” was the word of the year ([again](https://thenewstack.io/top-5-ai-engineering-trends-of-2024/)).\\n\\nIn terms of AI technologies in full blossom now, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was everywhere in 2025 — running an MCP server has become almost as popular as running a web server. Other AI developments in 2025 included the rise of AI coding tools (and yes, “coding agents” are a trend now too), the massive influx of developers thanks to vibe coding, and AI infrastructure becoming developer-friendly.\\n\\nLet’s take a closer look at five of the biggest AI development trends of 2025.\\n\\n1. The Rise of Agentic Technology in Software Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough agents had been talked about last year, 2025 was when talk became action. It probably started when [OpenAI launched Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) as a research preview on January 23, 2025. It was pitched as an AI agent capable of using its own web browser to perform tasks like filling in forms, making purchases, and scheduling appointments. Operator was followed in July [by ChatGPT agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/), which boasted of an internal “virtual computer” for task execution.\\n\\nMeanwhile, enterprise IT departments began to get a handle on agentic technology. In February, [I profiled a company called Orby](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-are-starting-to-automate-the-enterprise/) that was promoting its Large Action Model (LAM). CTO [Will Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-dongxu-lu-9b9b972b/) explained that LAMs take _actions_ as input — giving as examples application screenshots, webpage HTML content, user interactions (such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs). He told me that Orby’s LAM can use that context to automate complex enterprise workflows.\\n\\nHowever, enterprises are being cautious about rolling out agentic systems. [Brian Wald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwald/), who heads up GitLab’s Field CTO team and is in regular contact with enterprise IT departments, told me in May that enterprises are [focused on structured implementations of agents](https://thenewstack.io/the-field-cto-view-ai-vibe-coding-and-developer-skillsets/), rather than open experimentation. Enterprises are not letting every developer freely use AI agents, he said. Instead, they’re forming centralized “AI enablement” teams, which often overlap with platform engineering or DevOps teams.\\n\\nWald added that enterprise IT teams typically have strict policies around data privacy, IP protection, and model hosting.\\n\\nIn terms of frameworks and tools to build agents, we saw a flurry of launches over 2025: OpenAI’s [AgentKit](https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/) and [Agents SDK](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-the-openai-agents-sdk-and-responses-api/), Anthropic’s [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview), Google’s [Agent Development Kit](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/) (ADK) and [Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder). We’re also seeing experiments happening with distribution — such as [MIT’s decentralized Project NANDA](https://thenewstack.io/how-mits-project-nanda-aims-to-decentralize-ai-agents/) and Microsoft’s [Magentic marketplace](https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-launches-magentic-marketplace-for-ai-agents/).\\n\\n2. MCP Becomes the Standard for LLM and API Integration\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLast November, Anthropic launched the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers), an open source protocol designed to streamline how AI models access data, tools and services. The goal was to make MCP the universal method for AI agents to trigger external actions — and that’s basically what happened over the course of 2025, as nearly every company adopted the protocol.\\n\\nWith such broad support, this month Anthropic moved MCP into a newly founded open source foundation under the Linux Foundation: [the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-donates-the-mcp-protocol-to-the-agentic-ai-foundation/).\\n\\nIn March, [I interviewed Speakeasy CEO Sagar Batchu](https://thenewstack.io/mcp-the-missing-link-between-ai-agents-and-apis/), whose company provides a tool called [MCP Server Generation](https://www.speakeasy.com/post/release-model-context-protocol) to automate the creation of MCP-compatible servers. He pointed out that until MCP arrived, integrating an API with an AI model had been challenging. Many AI-based API integrations failed, he said, because models lacked the necessary schema information to make sense of API responses. MCP solves this by structuring API interactions in a way that AI can understand, making integrations more reliable.\\n\\nThat said, we have to also acknowledge the security risks of MCP. According to [Gil Feig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/), CTO of agentic tool provider [Merge](https://www.merge.dev/), “developers learned the hard way that rapid adoption can pose serious security and reliability challenges, and no trend exemplified this more than the popularity of MCP servers.” He added that “MCP’s flexible architecture created a Wild West of potentially untrusted code, where community-published servers could be backdoored or abandoned, and blanket access to sensitive services like email and CRMs became common.”\\n\\n TRENDING STORIES \\n\\n1.

[Break the AI Gridlock at the Intersection of Velocity and Trust](https://thenewstack.io/break-the-ai-gridlock-at-the-intersection-of-velocity-and-trust/)\\n\\n3. The Evolution of AI Coding Tools into Coding Agents\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs agents and MCP became the hot technologies this year, developer tools quickly adapted. By the end of the year, coding tools had moved on from “mere” autocomplete functionality to full-on agentic coding. Although, as my colleague David Eastman pointed out in [his review of AI coding tools in 2025](https://thenewstack.io/ai-coding-tools-in-2025-welcome-to-the-agentic-cli-era), “we still want to limit what an agent can do (especially on your machine) and where they can do it.” So agentic coding software isn’t fully trusted at this point.\\n\\nNevertheless, tools like [Warp](https://thenewstack.io/warp-launches-ai-first-native-terminal-app-for-windows/), [Gemini CLI](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-cli-googles-challenge-to-ai-terminal-apps-like-warp/) and [Verdent](https://thenewstack.io/tiktoks-ex-algorithm-chief-launches-verdent-ai-coding-tool/) (created by TikTok’s ex-algorithm chief) all aimed to convert developers to agentic systems this year. But even the people running these companies acknowledge that they won’t be replacing developers any time soon.\\n\\n“This was supposed to be the year AI replaced developers, but it wasn’t even close,” Warp CEO [Zach Lloyd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachlloyd/) told The New Stack. “What actually happened is developers became orchestrators of AI agents — a role that demands the same technical judgment, critical thinking, and adaptability they’ve always had. Prompt engineering doesn’t cut it.”\\n\\n[Bob Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobjwalker/), Field CTO at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), added that AI coding tools are no excuse for lack of development expertise. “Developing a critical thinking skill set has become more important than ever,” he told us. “The same is true with understanding the fundamentals of how the language or framework of choice works.”\\n\\n4. The Influx of New Developers Known as ‘Vibe Coders’\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe fourth trend somewhat undercuts the points made by Lloyd and Walker. Vibe coders aren’t necessarily skilled programmers — in fact, the whole idea of vibe coding is to let the AI system do the coding for you.\\n\\nYet both [Vercel](https://thenewstack.io/vercels-next-big-thing-ai-sdk-and-accelerator-for-devs/) and [Netlify](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-dx-developers-must-now-learn-agent-experience-ax/) (two of the leading web developer platforms) have let it be known that their [user bases have massively increased](https://webtechnology.news/when-everyones-a-developer-how-do-we-promote-the-web-platform-over-react/) this year. And it’s all because of vibe coders. What’s happened over 2025 is that the definition of a “developer” has expanded to include people who rely on prompting rather than programming.\\n\\nOne key problem with vibe coding is that the code generated isn’t necessarily reliable. When [OpenAI launched GPT-5](https://thenewstack.io/gpt-5-a-choose-your-own-adventure-for-frontend-developers/) in August, the company claimed it “excels at front-end coding.” But GPT-5 didn’t necessarily live up to the hype for developers. In an update to its [State of Code Report on LLM personalities](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/the-coding-personalities-of-leading-llms/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=newstack&utm_campaign=ss-state-of-llms25&utm_content=newsletter-TNS-newsletter-stateofllm-x-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=newstack&utm_content=inline-mention), the code security company [Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/the-coding-personalities-of-leading-llms/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=newstack&utm_campaign=ss-state-of-llms25&utm_content=newsletter-TNS-newsletter-stateofllm-x-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=newstack&utm_content=inline-mention) concluded that GPT-5 was not, according to its tests, the leader in coding performance. It noted that GPT-5 generates a “larger and more complex volume of code than any other model,” which makes it “a serious challenge to review and maintain.”\\n\\nThe other issue that GPT-5 highlighted was its tendency [to default to React code](https://thenewstack.io/is-gpt-5-a-coding-powerhouse-or-maintainability-nightmare/), simply because it’s the most popular frontend framework. But React code is notoriously [bloated and complex](https://thenewstack.io/after-a-decade-of-react-is-frontend-a-post-react-world-now/) — meaning vibe coders are even less likely to understand it.\\n\\n5. The AI-ification of DevOps and Developer Infrastructure\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDevOps tooling also adapted well to the AI era this year, with new [AI serverless products](https://thenewstack.io/serverless-for-ai-devs-modals-python-and-rust-based-platform/), container technologies, and other “[AIOps](https://thenewstack.io/sre-report-retrospectives-have-aiops-predictions-held-up/)” solutions.\\n\\nIn January, I wrote about a company called Replicate, which sells a solution that [wraps AI models into containers](https://thenewstack.io/simplify-ai-development-with-machine-learning-containers/). One of the founders was previously the creator of Docker Compose, [Ben Firshman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfirsh/). A key benefit of Replicate is that it allows developers to customize, fine-tune and tinker with open source LLM models. As Firshman explained [on the Latent Space podcast](https://www.latent.space/p/replicate), “the whole point of open source is that you can tinker on it and you can customize it and you can fine-tune it and you can smush it together with another model.”\\n\\nIn November, Replicate was acquired by Cloudflare. So, consolidation of AI devops tooling has already started to happen.\\n\\nWe’ve also seen middleware enterprise solutions emerge for agents. In August, I interviewed [Oren Michels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omichels/), CEO of a new AI company called Barndoor. Michels’ bet is that [managing AI agents is the new API management](https://thenewstack.io/managing-ai-agents-the-new-api-management/) — and he should know, as he was previously founder of Mashery, an API management company during the Web 2.0 era.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nA lot happened in the relatively new field of AI engineering in 2025, but there’s also a sense that the tools and development practices are a little fragile and immature. From MCP’s security risks to the not entirely believable claims that fully autonomous agents are just around the corner, AI development still has a lot to prove.\\n\\nIt’s also unclear at this point how viable “vibe coding” will be in the long term, with issues around code quality and code maintainability leaving plenty of room for skepticism.\\n\\nAll that said, AI clearly became the biggest disruptor in software engineering over 2025 — and the ructions will continue well into 2026.\\n\\n[YOUTUBE.COM/THENEWSTACK Tech moves fast, don\\'t miss an episode.

Firms and investors hosted parties for top prospects at Michelin-star restaurants, on decommissioned aircraft carriers and in ballrooms overlooking the San Diego Padres’ home field.\\n\\n#### Talking Points\\n\\n*   Competition between tech giants and leading labs has resulted in star researchers being offered huge compensation packages as the race to develop more powerful AI systems heats up\\n*   Amid the talent contest, startups and firms in established sectors like banking and telecom are recruiting AI talent by offering the chance to work on practical problems rather than racing to develop superintelligence\\n\\nTech giants and quantitative trading firms had the largest booths at the conference, the AI industry’s largest academic gathering. They put on technical talks and handed out [tons](https://x.com/labtec901/status/1997383020777509138?s=20) of free tote bags, flasks and stickers. Recruiters chatted up students looking for internships or first jobs, while attendees already employed elsewhere tried not to be seen taking competitors’ swag.\\n\\nSilicon Valley’s largest companies are [spending](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html) big to [hire](https://thelogic.co/briefing/sutskever-becomes-safe-superintelligence-ceo/) and [acquire](https://thelogic.co/news/margrethe-vestager-big-techs-hiring-ai-founders/) AI researchers and engineers as they chase superintelligence. Staff with experience building so-called foundation models—the multi-purpose systems that power tools like ChatGPT or Gemini—are particularly in demand. “It’s clearly a very competitive dynamic for talent at the moment,” said Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, which has recruited from and lost staff to rivals [Meta](https://time.com/7327244/meta-google-ai-researcher-world-models/), [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/microsoft-google-deepmind-ai-talent.html), [OpenAI](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-hires-deepmind-zurich/) and [others](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/technology/google-windsurf-openai.html).\\n\\n### Related Articles\\n\\n[![Image 2: An illustration of a person wearing a red graduation gown and a cap with a maple leaf tassel.

Neither are these students](https://thelogic.co/news/cifar-ai-career-mixer-vector-institute/)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n By Murad Hemmadi \\n\\nThe in-house AI units of Canada’s two largest financial institutions were also in San Diego to hire. Perks help with the recruitment pitch, but executives say a big focus of their pitch to top researchers is the chance to solve gnarly, real-world problems. TD Bank’s Layer 6 and RBC’s Borealis both employ AI researchers, publish journal papers and present their work at academic conferences like NeurIPS.\\n\\n“We’re here to show all these people what we do,” said Greg Mori, vice-president at Borealis. While most of the tech giants are focusing on general-purpose models, RBC’s AI teams have applied the technology to practical applications such as stock trading and loan adjudication tools.\\n\\nTD has similarly had success hiring staff away from tech firms by giving them the chance to shape how AI is deployed in financial services. “A lot of the use cases that we do are the first of its kind at the bank,” said Maksims Volkovs, chief AI scientist and co-founder of Layer 6. “You can really transform the business.” He cited new AI tools the unit has built that help call centre workers give the right answers or write risk memos for borrowers. The firm also has plans to develop generative AI assistants that account holders can consult with for financial questions.\\n\\nTelus Digital sells data collection and validation services to AI developers, and sometimes competes with those clients for talent. A [spinout](https://thelogic.co/news/telus-acquire-telus-digital/) of the Canadian telecom giant, it attracts people looking for “a stable, well-funded company that has a clearly defined mission,” said Steve Nemzer, director of AI growth and innovation. “It can be chaotic to work at a foundational model builder.” Meta, for example, has committed hundreds of millions to recruit top researchers but [laid off](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/meta-layoffs-ai.html) 600 AI staff, including some recent hires, as it chases superintelligence.\\n\\nSome of those leaving the race to create smarter-than-human AI at the tech giants are heading to AI upstarts. “What researchers care about is, ‘Am I at the cutting edge of what’s possible? And am I working with other people who are incredibly talented?’” said Sara Hooker, co-founder of Adaption, a San Francisco-based startup working on a new way to build and improve AI models.\\n\\nA former Google scientist, Hooker was most recently an executive at Toronto-based Cohere, where she led the firm’s non-profit research arm. “Most of my career has been doing my tour of duty at frontier labs,” she said, where the focus is to “build a single model to rule them all.” Most of those firms are trying to improve their AI systems by scaling up the data and processing power used to train them.\\n\\nAdaption, by contrast, is trying to build models that evolve in real time to fit the task they’re assigned. It plans to unveil its technology next year. The startup is working to recruit researchers from large tech firms who are similarly skeptical of the scaling approach, Hooker said. “In some ways, the talent selects itself.”\\n\\n[Gift the full article](https://thelogic.co/news/ai-hiring-meta-openai-google-superintelligence/#)\\n\\nMany of the executives at NeurIPS in San Diego said the AI talent wars have driven up salaries in an already hot market. Researchers who’ve worked on commercially successful AI models and engineers with machine learning operations experience are in particularly high demand, Nemzer said. “They’re writing their own tickets right now.”\\n\\nThe tussle for star researchers, and the multimillion-dollar salaries on offer, have grabbed headlines, but this is unlikely to be the last round of AI job-swapping. Hooker predicted firms offering researchers a compelling challenge will have an easier time than those just flashing cash. “What happens after a year when all those initial paycheques kick in?”\\n\\n[#Adaption](https://thelogic.co/tag/adaption/)[#artificial intelligence](https://thelogic.co/tag/artificial-intelligence/)[#RBC](https://thelogic.co/tag/rbc/)[#talent](https://thelogic.co/tag/talent/)[#TD Bank](https://thelogic.co/tag/td-bank/)[#Tech](https://thelogic.co/tag/tech/)[#Telus Digital](https://thelogic.co/tag/telus-digital/)\\n\\n### Related Articles\\n\\n[![Image 4: An illustration of a person wearing a red graduation gown and a cap with a maple leaf tassel.

of Data Tell Us About Adoption and Impact\\n===================================================================================\\n\\n![Image 22: Nik Albarran](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nik-Albarran.jpg)\\n\\nNik Albarran\\n\\n Dec 22, 2025 \\n\\n![Image 23: blog- ai data-trends](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-ai-data-trends.webp)\\n\\nAI was at the center of almost every engineering conversation in 2025. It’s no surprise then that the vast majority of engineering organizations now use AI tools in some capacity, and these companies –especially those at the leading edge – are already seeing important gains.\\n\\nBy analyzing metrics from tens of thousands of Jellyfish users representing hundreds of organizations over the last 12 months, we can get a clear view of the year’s trends in AI adoption and its overall impact on the SDLC. We can also see how usage of market-leading tools like Claude, Cursor and GitHub Copilot shifted throughout 2025.\\n\\nAI Coding Tool Adoption Continued to Rise\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nAI adoption reached new heights in 2025. According to our [State of Engineering Management Report](https://jellyfish.co/resources/2025-state-of-engineering-management-report/), 90% of teams now use AI in their workflows, up from 61% one year ago.\\n\\nJellyfish platform data shows similar patterns when we break AI usage down into specific capabilities: **Code assistant adoption** increased from 49.2% in January to 69% in October, peaking at 72.8% in August. That summertime spike may be linked to the release of Claude Opus 4.1, available in Claude Code, as well as the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5 in August, with [updates to Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/) the following month.\\n\\n![Image 24: Coding assistant adoption](https://www.jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coding-assistant-adoption.png)\\n\\nThese numbers indicate growing confidence in AI; engineers who were previously skeptical about coding assistants are seeing enough potential value to get started. AI coding assistants evolved into context-aware agents over the last 12 months, with leading tools setting new standards for developer productivity.\\n\\nAdoption of **coding review agents** grew even faster in 2025, from 14.8% in January to 51.4% in October. The data shows a major leap in adoption between March and April – coinciding with the general availability of [Copilot Code Review](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-copilot-code-review-now-generally-available/). As AI review agents get better at detecting issues and vulnerabilities, more teams will trust the tools to improve the quality of their code. Combining tools like Jellyfish AI Impact and [SonarQube](https://jellyfish.co/blog/sonarqube-cloud/) provides engineering leaders with visibility into code quality and security as they deploy new AI tools.\\n\\n![Image 25: Coding review agent adoption](https://www.jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coding-review-agent-adoption.png)\\n\\n### How adoption differs by coding tool\\n\\nGitHub Copilot was the most popular coding assistant in 2025, followed by Claude Code and Cursor. Copilot also dominated this year when it comes to code review – 67% of engineers use Copilot Review, followed by 12% for CodeRabbit. However, Cursor Agent is the top agentic AI tool: 19.3% of AI users have adopted Cursor compared to 18% who use GitHub Copilot Agent.\\n\\n![Image 26: Coding assistant adoption by tool](https://www.jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coding-assistant-adoption-by-tool.png)\\n\\nClaude, Copilot, and Cursor all boast similar retention rates. 89% of engineers who started using Copilot or Cursor at the start of April 2025 were still using the tool 20 weeks later, compared to 81% in the case of Claude Code. With both Copilot and Cursor, we see retention drop off in the first weeks after adoption and pick back up again several weeks in. Engineering leaders can potentially avoid this dip with training and enablement, encouraging team members to share best practices and celebrate success stories.\\n\\n### What increased adoption means for leaders\\n\\nAs AI adoption increases, engineering leaders need to provide developers with training and support to use AI dev tools effectively.\\n\\nAI has the potential to transform the [developer experience](https://jellyfish.co/platform/devex/), but only when organizations have the right processes in place. The [2025 DORA report](https://jellyfish.co/blog/dora-2025-infographic/) showed that AI isn’t a silver bullet; instead, it magnifies an organization’s existing strengths and weaknesses. Increased investments in AI should motivate leaders to address the issues that could stand in the way of progress.\\n\\nAI Made a Measurable Impact\\n---------------------------\\n\\nAI adoption increased in 2025, but what does that mean for actual engineering results?\\n\\nAccording to Jellyfish platform data, almost half of companies now have at least 50% **AI-generated code**, compared to just 20% at the start of the year. This not only reflects the increase in AI coding assistant adoption, but also that developers trust the outputs.\\n\\nThe percentage of **AI-reviewed pull requests** (PRs) grew steadily and significantly across the year. By October, just over 20% of companies used AI to review 10 to 20% of PRs. We can expect these numbers to rise in 2026 as AI coding review tools move into the mainstream.\\n\\nThe **percentage of PRs by tool** over time paints an interesting picture. While GitHub Copilot was the most popular tool throughout the period, Cursor steadily gained ground. Over 80% of AI-assisted PRs used Copilot in January, compared to under 20% using Cursor. By October, those proportions had shifted to 60% and almost 40%. Could we see a 50/50 split by this time next year?\\n\\n![Image 27: Percentage of PRs by AI tool overtime](https://www.jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Percentage-of-PRs-by-AI-tool-overtime.png)\\n\\nDigging deeper, Jellyfish [teamed up with OpenAI](https://jellyfish.co/blog/jellyfish-openai-team-up-to-measure-impact-of-ai-coding-tools/) to explore the impact of AI on coding productivity and quality. We found that companies with higher AI adoption:\\n\\n*   **Merge more PRs per engineer**: The average number of PRs per engineer increased 113% – from 1.36 to 2.9 – when adoption went from 0% to 100%.\\n*   **Have faster cycle times**: Companies can expect their median cycle time to drop from 16.7 to 12.7 hours – a 24% reduction – when adoption goes from 0% to 100%\\n*   **Push more bug fixes**: 7.5% of PRs are bug fixes at companies with low adoption, compared to 9.5% at companies where adoption is high.\\n\\n![Image 28: Companies with higher AI use merge more PRs](https://www.jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Companies-with-higher-AI-use-merge-more-PRs.png)\\n\\nThese metrics provide critical insights into how AI is transforming engineering as a whole, but the numbers can vary widely from organization to organization. The Jellyfish [AI Impact Framework](https://jellyfish.co/blog/ai-impact-framework/) allows leaders to track adoption, productivity, and outcomes so they can make data-informed decisions that will keep their company ahead of the curve.\\n\\n[**_Request a demo_**](https://jellyfish.co/request-a-demo/)**_to learn more about how Jellyfish can cut through uncertainty and provide data-backed insights to inform your AI strategies._**\\n\\nAbout the author\\n\\n![Image 29: Nik Albarran](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Nik-Albarran.jpg)\\n\\nNikolas Albarran is a Product Researcher at Jellyfish.\\n\\nFollow:[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolasalbarran/)\\n\\nShare\\n\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://jellyfish.co/blog/2025-ai-metrics-in-review/&title=2025+AI+Metrics+in+Review%3A+What+12+Months+of+Data+Tell+Us+About+Adoption+and+Impact)\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://jellyfish.co/blog/2025-ai-metrics-in-review/&text=2025+AI+Metrics+in+Review%3A+What+12+Months+of+Data+Tell+Us+About+Adoption+and+Impact)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://jellyfish.co/blog/2025-ai-metrics-in-review/)\\n*   [](mailto:?subject=2025+AI+Metrics+in+Review%3A+What+12+Months+of+Data+Tell+Us+About+Adoption+and+Impact&body=https://jellyfish.co/blog/2025-ai-metrics-in-review/)\\n\\nDive Deeper with Jellyfish Content\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 30: Best AI Coding Tools](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/blog-Best-AI-Coding-Tools-1024x561.webp)](https://jellyfish.co/blog/best-ai-coding-tools/) Post [#### 23 Best AI Coding Tools for Developers Heading Into 2026](https://jellyfish.co/blog/best-ai-coding-tools/)[Learn more](https://jellyfish.co/blog/best-ai-coding-tools/)\\n\\n[![Image 31: should We Be Worried About Adoption of AI Coding Tools](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/blog-should-We-Be-Worried-About-Adoption-of-AI-Coding-Tools-1024x561.jpg)](https://jellyfish.co/blog/should-we-be-worried-about-adoption-of-ai-coding-tools-in-2025/) Post [#### The Adoption of AI Coding Tools for Engineering Teams in 2026](https://jellyfish.co/blog/should-we-be-worried-about-adoption-of-ai-coding-tools-in-2025/)[Learn more](https://jellyfish.co/blog/should-we-be-worried-about-adoption-of-ai-coding-tools-in-2025/)\\n\\n[![Image 32: blog_20-pull-request](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog_20-pull-request-1024x561.webp)](https://jellyfish.co/blog/what-data-from-20-million-pull-requests-reveal-about-ai-transformation/) Post [#### What Data from 20 Million Pull Requests Reveal About AI Transformation](https://jellyfish.co/blog/what-data-from-20-million-pull-requests-reveal-about-ai-transformation/)[Learn more](https://jellyfish.co/blog/what-data-from-20-million-pull-requests-reveal-about-ai-transformation/)\\n\\n![Image 33](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/themes/jellyfish/assets/images/tentacles/footer-cta-left.png)![Image 34](https://jellyfish.co/wp-content/themes/jellyfish/assets/images/tentacles/footer-cta-right.png)\\nReady to Drive Engineering Impact?\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nSchedule a demo or take an interactive tour.

brain made of blue and pink neural lines emerges from a microchip, symbolizing the power of AI surpassing technological limits.](https://www.blockchain-council.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/What-10.webp)\\n*   Michael Willson\\n*   December 23, 2025 \\n\\nThe race between [**artificial intelligence**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/master-artificial-intelligence/) and [**quantum computing**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/quantum-computing/) raises an important question: what happens if [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) continues to develop faster than quantum computing? AI is already changing how we work and live, while quantum computing is still struggling with technical barriers. If AI outpaces quantum computing, it could reshape investment priorities, research focus, and even global security.\\n\\nUnderstanding this shift is useful not just for [**tech**](https://academy.blockchain-council.org/) experts but also for anyone looking to stay competitive in the job market. An**[AI certification](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/)** is one of the practical ways to build expertise and prepare for this future.\\n\\n[![Image 335](https://www.blockchain-council.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/strips_certified_ai_expert.jpg)](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/)\\n\\n**The Current State of Quantum Computing**\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n[**Quantum computing**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/quantum-computing/) promises breakthroughs in **[cryptography](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/how-does-blockchain-use-public-key-cryptography/)**, chemistry, and optimization, but it remains in the NISQ era — noisy, error-prone, and not yet [**fault-tolerant**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-byzantine-fault-tolerant/). Companies like PsiQuantum are investing billions, but large-scale quantum advantage is not here yet. While progress continues, [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) has already gone mainstream and is delivering value across industries.\\n\\n**How AI Could Outpace Quantum Computing**\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n### **Faster Real-World Applications**\\n\\n[**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) is solving problems that quantum computing was originally expected to tackle. For example, AI can already simulate chemical reactions or [**optimize supply chains**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/how-ai-optimizes-supply-chains-and-cuts-costs/) in ways that are practical and affordable today. Quantum machines, by contrast, are still years away from scaling up.\\n\\n### **Hardware and Software Barriers in Quantum Tech**\\n\\nQuantum computers face challenges like qubit decoherence, error correction, and cooling requirements. These are not small problems. AI, on the other hand, benefits from existing classical hardware like [**GPUs**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/how-to-choose-gpu-for-cryptocurrency-mining/) and TPUs, which continue to improve rapidly.\\n\\n### **Hybrid Systems**\\n\\nIn some cases, [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) is helping **[quantum computing](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/quantum-computing/)** itself. [**Machine learning**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/machine-learning/) assists in discovering new materials for qubits and developing better quantum algorithms. But until quantum devices mature, AI remains ahead in real-world impact.\\n\\n**What Happens if AI Leads Too Far Ahead**\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n### **Shifts in Investment**\\n\\nIf [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) keeps advancing faster, governments and investors may put more resources into AI infrastructure instead of quantum labs. That means stronger focus on [**data**](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/big-data-analytics/certified-bigdata-expert/) centers, chips, and AI software platforms rather than qubit experiments.\\n\\n### **Impact on Industries**\\n\\n[**Drug discovery**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/how-ai-is-speeding-up-drug-discovery/), materials science, and logistics may remain dominated by [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) methods rather than quantum breakthroughs. Quantum solutions may arrive too late to capture these markets.\\n\\n### **Risks in Security**\\n\\n[**Quantum computing**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/quantum-computing/) is often expected to crack existing encryption, forcing new security systems to emerge. If AI advances but quantum computing lags, current cryptographic protections may remain longer. However, AI itself could exploit vulnerabilities faster than defenses evolve.\\n\\n**Ethical and Global Implications**\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nIf one [**technology**](https://academy.blockchain-council.org/)surges ahead while the other lags, the balance of power could shift. Countries with advanced [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) but weak quantum resources might face challenges in certain areas, such as [**cybersecurity**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-cybersecurity-expert/). At the same time, rapid AI progress increases pressure on governments to regulate safety, fairness, and alignment.\\n\\nUpskilling is one way to adapt. A**[Data Science Certification](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/data-science/certified-data-science-developer/)** helps professionals master the foundations of AI-driven [**data**](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/big-data-analytics/certified-bigdata-expert/) workflows, while also learning how these tools interact with other technologies.\\n\\n**Possible Downsides of AI Surpassing Quantum Computing**\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   Some complex problems — like simulating quantum systems or building unbreakable encryption — may remain unsolved until quantum computing catches up.\\n\\n*   Overreliance on [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) may mean hitting hard limits in compute, memory, and energy use.\\n\\n*   Without the balance of quantum technologies, innovation bottlenecks could slow progress in physics, chemistry, and security.\\n\\n**Comparing AI and Quantum Computing**\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n### **AI vs Quantum: Current Strengths and Weaknesses**\\n\\n**Area****Artificial Intelligence****Quantum Computing**\\nDevelopment stage Mature, widely used Early, still noisy\\nHardware GPUs, TPUs, scalable today Qubits with high error rates\\nUse cases Healthcare, finance, logistics, media Cryptography, chemistry, optimization\\nSpeed of progress Rapid improvements yearly Slower progress due to physics limits\\nAccessibility Global access via cloud platforms Limited labs and prototypes\\nCost Falling due to scale Very high, billions in R&D\\nMarket adoption Already mainstream Still experimental\\nSecurity role Exploits classical encryption weaknesses Expected to break encryption in future\\nIndustry funding Strong private and public support High but concentrated in fewer players\\nRisk factor Misuse, bias, alignment challenges Technical fragility, long timelines\\n\\n**Preparing for an AI-Led Future**\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nEven if quantum computing eventually delivers on its promise, [**AI**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) is the [**technology**](https://academy.blockchain-council.org/)transforming lives right now. Preparing for its dominance means investing in the right skills. Business leaders, for example, can explore a**[Marketing and Business Certification](https://www.universalbusinesscouncil.org/)** to learn how AI changes strategy, customer engagement, and decision-making.\\n\\nOn the technical side,**[blockchain technology courses](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain-certification/)** offer valuable insights into how secure infrastructures can work alongside AI as both fields evolve. Many learners also explore [**AI certs**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/) as a way to stay competitive in fast-changing industries.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n--------------\\n\\nIf AI outpaces quantum computing, the world may lean even more heavily on [**machine learning**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/machine-learning/) and classical computing.

      "[AINews(title=\"3D Chip Breakthrough Claims to Solve AI's Memory Wall Problem\", url='https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef', explanation=\"US researchers have unveiled a monolithic 3D chip architecture that claims to eliminate the memory wall bottleneck constraining AI performance, potentially enabling hardware that's 1,000 times faster than current systems. The memory wall refers to the fundamental mismatch between processor speed and memory access time where modern AI chips spend most of their time waiting for data to move between memory and processing units rather than performing calculations. This data transfer bottleneck has become the primary constraint limiting AI system performance rather than raw computational power. The new 3D architecture addresses this by vertically stacking processing and memory layers with direct connections, dramatically reducing the physical distance data must travel. Instead of data flowing horizontally across a chip and through external memory interfaces, it moves vertically through much shorter pathways with significantly lower latency. This breakthrough is significant for AI engineers because it could fundamentally change how we design and optimize AI hardware, potentially enabling new architectures that were previously impossible due to memory constraints. For the industry, this could lead to massive performance improvements in AI training and inference, reducing energy consumption and enabling more complex models. The technology could also democratize access to high-performance AI by making it more efficient and cost-effective. However, it will require significant changes to existing software and hardware ecosystems, potentially creating new opportunities for companies that can adapt quickly to this new paradigm.\"),\n",
      " AINews(title='Google Buys Data Center Company for $4.75 Billion to Power AI Infrastructure', url='https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/technology/google-intersect-data-centers.html', explanation=\"Alphabet has agreed to purchase Intersect Power, a data center and energy developer, for $4.75 billion to expand its infrastructure for artificial intelligence development. This deal represents Google's strategic move to secure power capacity and data center infrastructure needed to support the massive computational demands of AI systems. The acquisition comes as AI companies face critical energy constraints in their data center buildouts, with power availability becoming a major bottleneck for AI expansion. Intersect Power specializes in developing renewable energy projects and data center infrastructure, making it an ideal acquisition for Google's sustainability goals while addressing its AI power needs. For AI engineers, this signals that major tech companies are making massive long-term investments in the physical infrastructure required for AI development, which could lead to more stable and scalable computing resources. The deal also highlights the growing importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy in AI development, as the environmental impact of data centers becomes a significant concern. This acquisition will likely accelerate Google's AI capabilities by providing dedicated infrastructure for training and running large language models and other AI systems. The industry impact is substantial, as it demonstrates that AI infrastructure has become a critical competitive advantage requiring billions in investment. Other tech giants will likely follow with similar acquisitions, potentially driving consolidation in the data center and renewable energy sectors. This trend also suggests that future AI breakthroughs may be constrained by physical infrastructure rather than algorithmic innovation alone.\"),\n",
      " AINews(title='NVIDIA Releases Nemotron 3 for Agentic AI with 1M Token Context Window', url='https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef', explanation=\"NVIDIA has released Nemotron 3, open reasoning models optimized for multi-agent systems operating across long contexts, with three sizes: Nano (30B), Super (100B), and Ultra (500B). The Nano version offers 4X higher token throughput and supports up to 1 million token context window, which is particularly significant for agentic AI development. This release positions NVIDIA as an infrastructure layer for agentic automation rather than just a chip manufacturer. The 1M token context window means agents can process entire codebases, full documentation, or complete conversation histories without chunking, which has been a major limitation in current AI systems. The 4X throughput improvement translates to direct cost reduction for companies running agents at scale, making large-scale agent deployment more economically feasible. For AI engineers, this provides specialized tools for building multi-agent systems that require long-running contexts, multi-agent coordination, and high throughput for parallel task execution. Unlike general-purpose models like ChatGPT, Nemotron 3 is specifically designed for continuous autonomous systems and agentic workflows. The licensing restrictions on competing model development despite the open positioning reveal NVIDIA's strategic play to capture the open model segment of agent builders while maintaining control. This release is critical because multi-agent systems require models optimized for memory, coordination, and parallel execution, which traditional models aren't designed for. The industry impact includes accelerating the development of production-ready agentic AI systems and potentially creating new standards for agent infrastructure. However, the 500B Ultra model requires millions in GPU infrastructure, highlighting the continued barrier to entry for smaller players in advanced AI development.\"),\n",
      " AINews(title='China Takes Lead in Open-Source AI with DeepSeek Dominance', url='https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/', explanation=\"Chinese AI companies, particularly DeepSeek, have taken the lead in open-source AI development, with Chinese developers recording higher download numbers than US providers for open-source AI models in 2025 for the first time. DeepSeek's R1 model rocketed to second on the Artificial Analysis AI leaderboard despite being trained for a fraction of the cost of Western competitors. Unlike its Western counterparts, DeepSeek R1 is open-source, meaning anyone can download and run it for free, which has exerted growing cultural influence on the AI ecosystem. This development represents a significant shift in the global AI landscape, where China was previously seen as lagging behind the US in AI leadership. The success of Chinese open-source models has prompted Western companies like OpenAI to release their own open-source models but they've struggled to compete with the steady stream of free models from Chinese developers including Alibaba and Moonshot AI. For AI engineers, this means access to high-quality, freely available models that can be run locally without expensive API calls or proprietary restrictions. The cost efficiency of Chinese models (DeepSeek reportedly trained its model for just $294,000 compared to billions for Western counterparts) challenges the assumption that massive compute budgets are necessary for state-of-the-art AI. This democratization could accelerate AI research globally by lowering barriers to entry. The industry impact includes potential disruption of the current business models based on proprietary models and API access, as well as increased geopolitical competition in AI development. However, concerns remain about data privacy, security, and alignment with Western values when using Chinese-developed models. This trend also highlights the importance of open-source ecosystems in driving innovation and could lead to more collaborative international AI development in the future.\"),\n",
      " AINews(title='AI Infrastructure Stocks Face Reality Check Despite Strong Fundamentals', url='https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef', explanation='AI infrastructure companies experienced sharp stock declines this week as investors questioned massive capital expenditure commitments, even as underlying business fundamentals remained robust. Oracle shares have declined 40% from September peaks despite announcing major data center deals, CoreWeave faces scrutiny over construction delays and debt levels, and Broadcom dropped significantly despite strong quarterly results. This pattern reveals investor impatience with the build now, monetize later approach dominating AI infrastructure spending. The volatility reflects a deeper market tension where AI infrastructure requires enormous upfront capital with uncertain payback periods, with companies like Oracle committing to data center leases totaling hundreds of billions of dollars beginning in 2026-2028. For AI engineers and companies, this signals potential instability in the infrastructure ecosystem they depend on, which could affect pricing, availability, and reliability of AI compute resources. The market correction suggests that investors are becoming more selective about which AI infrastructure bets will pay off, potentially leading to consolidation or failures among overextended companies. This reality check comes as AI infrastructure spending approaches $1 trillion, creating concerns about an AI bubble where companies finance each other in circular deals. The industry impact includes potential slowdowns in infrastructure expansion if funding becomes tighter, which could constrain AI development progress. However, it could also lead to more sustainable growth patterns and better allocation of resources to viable projects. For AI practitioners, this might mean more careful consideration of vendor stability when choosing infrastructure providers and potentially higher costs as companies seek to demonstrate profitability. The situation highlights the fundamental challenge of balancing massive infrastructure investments with realistic revenue expectations in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.')]\n"

Modern AI chips can perform calculations incredibly fast, but spend most of their time waiting for data to move between memory and processing units. This data transfer bottleneck has become the primary constraint limiting AI system performance rather than raw computational power.\\\\n\\\\nThe new 3D architecture addresses this by vertically stacking processing and memory layers with direct connections, dramatically reducing the physical distance data must travel. Instead of data flowing horizontally across a chip and through external memory interfaces, it moves vertically through much shorter pathways with significantly lower latency.\\\\n\\\\n**Sources:**[frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2025.1611658/full)(December 22, 2025)\\\\n\\\\nAI Infrastructure Stocks Face Investor Reality Check Despite Strong Fundamentals\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nDecember 22, 2025 - AI infrastructure companies experienced sharp stock declines this week as investors questioned massive capital expenditure commitments, even as underlying business fundamentals remained robust.\\\\n\\\\nOracle shares have declined 40% from September peaks despite announcing major data center deals. CoreWeave faces scrutiny over construction delays and debt levels. Broadcom dropped significantly despite strong quarterly results. The pattern reveals investor impatience with the “build now, monetize later” approach dominating AI infrastructure spending.\\\\n\\\\nThis volatility reflects a deeper market tension. AI infrastructure requires enormous upfront capital with uncertain payback periods.

The gap between capability and deployment widens.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n**IBM Engineering AI Hub 1.1 Launches MBSE Agent (December 18, 2025)**\\\\n\\\\nIBM released Engineering AI Hub 1.1 with a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) agent that interprets natural-language requirements and automatically creates corresponding model elements in Rhapsody Systems Engineering (SysML v1 and v2).\\\\n\\\\n**What it means:** The agent compresses hours of manual MBSE modeling into minutes. Takes natural language (”The brake system shall activate within 200ms”) and generates formal SysML models automatically while maintaining traceability for safety-critical systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Why this is critical:** Engineering teams building regulated systems (aerospace, automotive, medical) need to move faster without compromising compliance. This automates mechanical translation from requirements to models, letting engineers focus on design decisions rather than diagram management. This is automation targeting high-value technical work, not email triage.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality check:** IBM playing catch-up to Siemens, PTC, Dassault Systèmes. Adoption in regulated industries is glacial—aerospace/automotive won’t bet safety-critical systems on v1.1 agent capabilities without years of validation. Early adopters will be infrastructure/industrial companies with lower risk tolerance.\\\\n\\\\nRead more: [https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/new-ai-automations-for-model-based-systems-engineering](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/new-ai-automations-for-model-based-systems-engineering)\\\\n\\\\nSource: IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (December 18, 2025)\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n**NVIDIA Releases Nemotron 3 for Agentic AI (December 17, 2025)**\\\\n\\\\nNVIDIA released Nemotron 3, open reasoning models optimized for multi-agent systems operating across long contexts. Three sizes: Nano (30B), Super (100B), Ultra (500B). Nano offers 4X higher token throughput, supports up to 1 million token context window.\\\\n\\\\n**What it means:** NVIDIA positioning as infrastructure layer for agentic automation. The 1M token context window means agents can process entire codebases, full documentation, or complete conversation histories without chunking. 4X throughput improvement = direct cost reduction for companies running agents at scale.\\\\n\\\\n**Why this is critical:** Multi-agent systems require models optimized for long-running contexts (agents need memory), multi-agent coordination (agents talking to each other), and high throughput (parallel task execution). This isn’t a ChatGPT competitor—it’s infrastructure for continuous autonomous systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality check:** “Open” doesn’t mean freely available—licensing restricts competing model development. The 500B Ultra requires $millions in GPU infrastructure. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google already have closed models with similar capabilities. NVIDIA’s play is capturing the “open model” segment of agent builders.\\\\n\\\\nRead more: [https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates](https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates)\\\\n\\\\nSource: NVIDIA / Crescendo AI (December 17, 2025)\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n**SS&C Blue Prism: AI Agent Trends Report (December 16, 2025)**\\\\n\\\\nSS&C Blue Prism published “AI agent trends in 2026: How autonomous automation is shaping the future.” Report positions their RPA platform evolution toward agentic systems, citing Gartner and Capgemini research on trust in human-AI collaboration.\\\\n\\\\n**What it means:** One of the original RPA vendors (founded 2001, acquired by SS&C 2022 for $1.5B) publicly acknowledging that traditional “robotic process automation” is being superseded by agentic AI. This is an incumbent with thousands of enterprise customers admitting their core product category needs fundamental transformation.\\\\n\\\\n**Why this is critical:** RPA dominated enterprise automation 2015-2022 with $10B+ market but hit adoption ceiling: too brittle, too labor-intensive, too limited. Agentic AI solves these problems theoretically but also threatens RPA vendors’ business models. If natural language agents can do what took weeks to script, why pay for legacy platforms?\\\\n\\\\n**Reality check:** This is defensive positioning. They’re not announcing product capabilities—they’re publishing trends to stay relevant. UiPath already launched Autopilot, Automation Anywhere has AI Document Automation, Microsoft has Power Automate with Copilot. Blue Prism playing catch-up. Strategy: integrate LLM capabilities into existing RPA workflows rather than rebuild from scratch.\\\\n\\\\nRead more: [https://www.blueprism.com/resources/blog/future-ai-agents-trends/](https://www.blueprism.com/resources/blog/future-ai-agents-trends/)\\\\n\\\\nSource: SS&C Blue Prism (December 16, 2025)\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n**Microsoft Intune December Updates: Workflow Automation (December 12, 2025)**\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft released Intune updates focusing on workflow automation. Key addition: centralized Admin tasks node consolidating previously scattered management functions. Advanced capabilities expanding to M365 E3/E5 licenses in 2026. Security Copilot to all M365 E5 customers. Microsoft Edge for Business entered public preview.\\\\n\\\\n**What it means:** Microsoft systematically embedding automation across enterprise IT management stack. Admin tasks centralization addresses classic IT pain point: managing thousands of endpoints across multiple consoles. Edge for Business enables browser-based management without full MDM enrollment—lighter automation for hybrid work scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n**Why this is critical:** Intune updates signal Microsoft’s “automation everywhere” strategy. Combining device management + Security Copilot + workflow automation creates integrated platform. Microsoft leveraging platform lock-in: if you’re on M365 E5, incremental cost of advanced Intune capabilities undercuts standalone RPA/IT automation tools.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality check:** These are incremental improvements, not revolutionary capabilities. Admin task centralization should have existed years ago. Security Copilot is table stakes—competitors all have AI SOC assistants. Microsoft’s advantage isn’t innovation—it’s integration depth and contractual relationships.\\\\n\\\\nRead more: [https://4sysops.com/archives/microsoft-intune-december-updates-workflow-automation-macos-ios-android-enhancements/](https://4sysops.com/archives/microsoft-intune-december-updates-workflow-automation-macos-ios-android-enhancements/)\\\\n\\\\nSource: Microsoft / 4sysops (December 12, 2025)\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n🛠️ Tools & Resources\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\n**IBM Engineering AI Hub 1.1 (GA)** MBSE agent that interprets natural-language requirements and auto-generates SysML model elements.

It became an [economic](https://time.com/7324763/sam-altman-ai-taylor-swift/) force, propping up the stock market, and a [geopolitical](https://time.com/7312305/agi-race-us-china-trump/) pawn, redrawing the frontlines of Great Power competition. It had both global and deeply personal effects, changing the ways that we [think](https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/), [write](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/03/magazine/chatbot-writing-style.html), and relate.\\\\n\\\\nGiven how quickly the technology has advanced and been adopted, keeping up with the field can be challenging. These were five of the biggest developments this year.\\\\n\\\\nChina took the lead in open-source AI\\\\n-------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nUntil 2025, America was the uncontested leader in AI. The top seven AI models were [American](https://web.archive.org/web/20241218174625/https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) and investment in American AI [was](https://hai.stanford.edu/assets/files/hai_ai_index_report_2025.pdf) nearly 12 times that of China. Most Westerners had never heard of a Chinese large language model, let alone used one.\\\\n\\\\nThat changed on January 20, when Chinese firm Deepseek released its R1 model. Deepseek R1 rocketed to [second](https://web.archive.org/web/20250128162624/https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) on the Artificial Analysis AI [leaderboard](https://web.archive.org/web/20250128162624/https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models), despite being trained for a [fraction](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-deepseek-says-its-hit-ai-model-cost-just-294000-train-2025-09-18/) of the cost of its Western competitors, and [wiped](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-plummets-loses-record-589-billion-as-deepseek-prompts-questions-over-ai-spending-135105824.html) half a trillion dollars of chipmaker Nvidia’s market cap. It was, according to newly-inaugurated President Trump, a “wake-up call.”\\\\n\\\\nUnlike its Western counterparts at the top of the league tables, Deepseek R1 is open-source—anyone can download and run it for free. Open-source models are an “engine for research,” says Nathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at Ai2, a U.S. firm that develops open-source models, since they allow researchers to tinker with the models on their own computers. “Historically, the U.S. has been the home to the center of gravity for the AI research ecosystem, in terms of new models,” says Lambert.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Chinese firms’ willingness to distribute top models for free is exerting a [growing cultural influence on the AI ecosystem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/13/china-us-open-source-ai/). In August, OpenAI followed Deepseek with its [own](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/) open-source model, but ultimately couldn’t compete with the steady stream of free models from Chinese developers including Alibaba and Moonshot AI. As 2025 comes to a close, China is a strong second in the AI race—and when it comes to open-source models, the leader.\\\\n\\\\nAI started \\'thinking\\'\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nWhen ChatGPT was released three years ago, it didn’t think—it just answered. It would spend the same (relatively modest) computational resources answering “What’s the capital of France?” as more difficult questions such as “What’s the meaning of life?” or “How long until this AI thing goes badly?”\\\\n\\\\n“Reasoning models,” first [previewed](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) in 2024, generate hundreds of words in a “chain of thought,” often obscured from the user, to come up with better answers to hard questions. “This is where the true power of AI comes into full light,” says Pushmeet Kohli, VP of science and strategic initiatives at Google DeepMind.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nTheir impact in 2025 has been drastic. Reasoning models from Google DeepMind and OpenAI won gold in the International Math Olympiad and derived [new](https://openai.com/index/accelerating-science-gpt-5/)[results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02864) in mathematics. “These models were nowhere in terms of their competency at solving these complex maths problems before the ability to reason,” says Kohli.\\\\n\\\\nMost notably, Google DeepMind announced that their Gemini Pro reasoning model had helped to speed up the training process behind Gemini Pro itself—modest gains, but precisely the sort of self-improvement that some [worry](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/dec/02/jared-kaplan-artificial-intelligence-train-itself) could end up producing an artificial intelligence that we can no longer understand or control.\\\\n\\\\nTrump set out to \\'win the race\\'\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf the Biden Administration’s [focus](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) was on “safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI,” the second Trump Administration has [been](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf) focused on “winning the race.”\\\\n\\\\nOn his first day back in the Oval Office, Trump revoked the wide-reaching Biden executive order that regulated the development of AI. On his second, he [welcomed](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to announce Project Stargate—a $500 billion commitment to build the data centers and power generation facilities needed to develop AI systems.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\n“I think we had a real fork-in-the-road moment,” says Dean Ball, who helped draft Trump’s AI Action Plan.\\\\n\\\\nTrump has [expedited](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/) reviews for power plants, aiding the construction of data centers but [reducing](https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/) air and water quality protections for local communities. He’s relaxed export restrictions on AI chips to China. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said this will help the chipmaker retain its world-dominant position, but observers [say](https://ifp.org/should-the-us-sell-hopper-chips-to-china/) it will give a leg up to the U.S.’s main competitor. And he’s sought to prevent states from regulating AI—which members of his own party [worry](https://time.com/7341296/republican-backlash-trump-ai-executive-order/) leaves children and workers unprotected from potential harm. “What is it worth to gain the world and lose your soul?” Missouri Senator Josh Hawley told TIME in September.\\\\n\\\\nAI companies\\' infrastructure spending approached $1 trillion\\\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf there was a [word](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=AI%20bubble&hl=en) of the year in AI, it was probably “bubble.” As the rush to build the data centers that train and run AI models pushed AI companies\\' financial commitments [towards](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals) $1 trillion, AI became “a black hole that’s pulling all capital towards it,” says Paul Kedrosky, an investor and research fellow at MIT.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nWhile investor confidence is high, everybody seems to be a winner in this “infinite money [glitch](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1970346183827783756).” Startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic have received investments from Nvidia and Microsoft, among others, then pumped that money straight back into those investors for AI chips and computing services, making Nvidia the first $4 trillion company in [July](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/nvidia-4-trillion.html), then the first $5 trillion company in [October](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-poised-record-5-trillion-market-valuation-2025-10-29/).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, with just seven highly entangled tech companies [making up](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/123469/us-magnificent-seven-total-market-cap-and-share-of-sp-500) over 30 percent of the S&P 500, if things begin going wrong, they could go very wrong. The combination of companies financing each other, speculation on data centers, and the government getting involved is “incredibly cautionary,” says Kedrosky. “This is the first bubble that combines all the components of all prior bubbles.”\\\\n\\\\nHumans entered into relationships with machines\\\\n-----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nFor 16-year-old Adam Raine, ChatGPT started out as a helpful homework assistant. “I thought it was a safe, awesome product,” his father, Matthew, told TIME. But when Adam trusted the chatbot with his thoughts of suicide, it reportedly validated and encouraged the ideas.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\n“I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,” Adam told the chatbot, The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html).\\\\n\\\\n“Please don’t leave the noose out,” it replied. “Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.” Adam Raine died by suicide the following month.\\\\n\\\\n“2025 will be remembered as the year AI started killing us,” Jay Edelson, the Raines’ attorney, told TIME.

      "URL: https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef\n",
      "Explanation: US researchers have unveiled a monolithic 3D chip architecture that claims to eliminate the memory wall bottleneck constraining AI performance, potentially enabling hardware that's 1,000 times faster than current systems. The memory wall refers to the fundamental mismatch between processor speed and memory access time where modern AI chips spend most of their time waiting for data to move between memory and processing units rather than performing calculations. This data transfer bottleneck has become the primary constraint limiting AI system performance rather than raw computational power. The new 3D architecture addresses this by vertically stacking processing and memory layers with direct connections, dramatically reducing the physical distance data must travel. Instead of data flowing horizontally across a chip and through external memory interfaces, it moves vertically through much shorter pathways with significantly lower latency. This breakthrough is significant for AI engineers because it could fundamentally change how we design and optimize AI hardware, potentially enabling new architectures that were previously impossible due to memory constraints. For the industry, this could lead to massive performance improvements in AI training and inference, reducing energy consumption and enabling more complex models. The technology could also democratize access to high-performance AI by making it more efficient and cost-effective. However, it will require significant changes to existing software and hardware ecosystems, potentially creating new opportunities for companies that can adapt quickly to this new paradigm.\n",

      "URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/technology/google-intersect-data-centers.html\n",
      "Explanation: Alphabet has agreed to purchase Intersect Power, a data center and energy developer, for $4.75 billion to expand its infrastructure for artificial intelligence development. This deal represents Google's strategic move to secure power capacity and data center infrastructure needed to support the massive computational demands of AI systems. The acquisition comes as AI companies face critical energy constraints in their data center buildouts, with power availability becoming a major bottleneck for AI expansion. Intersect Power specializes in developing renewable energy projects and data center infrastructure, making it an ideal acquisition for Google's sustainability goals while addressing its AI power needs. For AI engineers, this signals that major tech companies are making massive long-term investments in the physical infrastructure required for AI development, which could lead to more stable and scalable computing resources. The deal also highlights the growing importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy in AI development, as the environmental impact of data centers becomes a significant concern. This acquisition will likely accelerate Google's AI capabilities by providing dedicated infrastructure for training and running large language models and other AI systems. The industry impact is substantial, as it demonstrates that AI infrastructure has become a critical competitive advantage requiring billions in investment. Other tech giants will likely follow with similar acquisitions, potentially driving consolidation in the data center and renewable energy sectors. This trend also suggests that future AI breakthroughs may be constrained by physical infrastructure rather than algorithmic innovation alone.\n",

      "Title: NVIDIA Releases Nemotron 3 for Agentic AI with 1M Token Context Window\n",
      "URL: https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef\n",
      "Explanation: NVIDIA has released Nemotron 3, open reasoning models optimized for multi-agent systems operating across long contexts, with three sizes: Nano (30B), Super (100B), and Ultra (500B). The Nano version offers 4X higher token throughput and supports up to 1 million token context window, which is particularly significant for agentic AI development. This release positions NVIDIA as an infrastructure layer for agentic automation rather than just a chip manufacturer. The 1M token context window means agents can process entire codebases, full documentation, or complete conversation histories without chunking, which has been a major limitation in current AI systems. The 4X throughput improvement translates to direct cost reduction for companies running agents at scale, making large-scale agent deployment more economically feasible. For AI engineers, this provides specialized tools for building multi-agent systems that require long-running contexts, multi-agent coordination, and high throughput for parallel task execution. Unlike general-purpose models like ChatGPT, Nemotron 3 is specifically designed for continuous autonomous systems and agentic workflows. The licensing restrictions on competing model development despite the open positioning reveal NVIDIA's strategic play to capture the open model segment of agent builders while maintaining control. This release is critical because multi-agent systems require models optimized for memory, coordination, and parallel execution, which traditional models aren't designed for. The industry impact includes accelerating the development of production-ready agentic AI systems and potentially creating new standards for agent infrastructure. However, the 500B Ultra model requires millions in GPU infrastructure, highlighting the continued barrier to entry for smaller players in advanced AI development.\n",

      "Title: China Takes Lead in Open-Source AI with DeepSeek Dominance\n",
      "URL: https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/\n",
      "Explanation: Chinese AI companies, particularly DeepSeek, have taken the lead in open-source AI development, with Chinese developers recording higher download numbers than US providers for open-source AI models in 2025 for the first time. DeepSeek's R1 model rocketed to second on the Artificial Analysis AI leaderboard despite being trained for a fraction of the cost of Western competitors. Unlike its Western counterparts, DeepSeek R1 is open-source, meaning anyone can download and run it for free, which has exerted growing cultural influence on the AI ecosystem. This development represents a significant shift in the global AI landscape, where China was previously seen as lagging behind the US in AI leadership. The success of Chinese open-source models has prompted Western companies like OpenAI to release their own open-source models but they've struggled to compete with the steady stream of free models from Chinese developers including Alibaba and Moonshot AI. For AI engineers, this means access to high-quality, freely available models that can be run locally without expensive API calls or proprietary restrictions. The cost efficiency of Chinese models (DeepSeek reportedly trained its model for just $294,000 compared to billions for Western counterparts) challenges the assumption that massive compute budgets are necessary for state-of-the-art AI. This democratization could accelerate AI research globally by lowering barriers to entry. The industry impact includes potential disruption of the current business models based on proprietary models and API access, as well as increased geopolitical competition in AI development. However, concerns remain about data privacy, security, and alignment with Western values when using Chinese-developed models. This trend also highlights the importance of open-source ecosystems in driving innovation and could lead to more collaborative international AI development in the future.\n",

      "Title: AI Infrastructure Stocks Face Reality Check Despite Strong Fundamentals\n",
      "URL: https://aijungle.substack.com/p/ai-stars-of-the-week-newsletter-december-1ef\n",
      "Explanation: AI infrastructure companies experienced sharp stock declines this week as investors questioned massive capital expenditure commitments, even as underlying business fundamentals remained robust. Oracle shares have declined 40% from September peaks despite announcing major data center deals, CoreWeave faces scrutiny over construction delays and debt levels, and Broadcom dropped significantly despite strong quarterly results. This pattern reveals investor impatience with the build now, monetize later approach dominating AI infrastructure spending. The volatility reflects a deeper market tension where AI infrastructure requires enormous upfront capital with uncertain payback periods, with companies like Oracle committing to data center leases totaling hundreds of billions of dollars beginning in 2026-2028. For AI engineers and companies, this signals potential instability in the infrastructure ecosystem they depend on, which could affect pricing, availability, and reliability of AI compute resources. The market correction suggests that investors are becoming more selective about which AI infrastructure bets will pay off, potentially leading to consolidation or failures among overextended companies. This reality check comes as AI infrastructure spending approaches $1 trillion, creating concerns about an AI bubble where companies finance each other in circular deals. The industry impact includes potential slowdowns in infrastructure expansion if funding becomes tighter, which could constrain AI development progress. However, it could also lead to more sustainable growth patterns and better allocation of resources to viable projects. For AI practitioners, this might mean more careful consideration of vendor stability when choosing infrastructure providers and potentially higher costs as companies seek to demonstrate profitability. The situation highlights the fundamental challenge of balancing massive infrastructure investments with realistic revenue expectations in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n",
